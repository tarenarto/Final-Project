There were two APIs used for development and implementation of the gas tracker web application. The first API utilized was the Javascript geolocation API [3] used for geo tracking and location services in identifying driver routes. The Javascript geolocation API can provide current position locations through the use of navigator.geolocation in javascript and has two methods of discerning user location. The first method used for the project is the Geolocation.getCurrentPosition() that returns a geolocationposition object which in this case was latitude and longitude coordinates. The second method used was the Geolocation.watchPosition() which returns new geolocation objects each time the users position changes an example of which being coordinates returned as the user is moving allowing for a recreation of the route taken.
	The second API used in this project was the server-client intermediary developed to communicate the information gathered by the geolocation API and communicate it to the back end where the geospatial coordinate data is then stored locally in a JSON file on a trip by trip basis. This allows geolocation data for specific trips to be retrieved and evaluated at any point. An example of this would be when a user starts a trip using our web application as soon as they end their trip the geospatial data array collected is pushed to the back end using our developed API. the developed API uses app.get and app.get and an async function (req, res)  while JSON.stringify changes the geolocation data format for storage in a JSON file. The intermediary would then return the JSON coordinates to the front end map for route tracking.
